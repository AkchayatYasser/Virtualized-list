  const itemHeight = 50; // Height of each item in pixels
  const visibleItemCount = 10; // Number of items visible in the viewport

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Virtualized List Example</h1>
      <VirtualizedList data={data} itemHeight={itemHeight} visibleItemCount={visibleItemCount} />
    </div>
